# GRAPH IMPLEMENTATION 
- This code shows an implemetation of a graph

 ### Following funtions are covered within the code
------------
+ Implemeting a graph with user given data (Following data can be input)
  + number of vertices in the graph
  + vertex data (interger)
  + edges
  + weight of the edges
 + After the initilization user can edit the graph if needed
  + enter a new 
  + delete a vertex
  + delete an edge
  + create an edge
 + User can delete the existing graph and create a new graph
 + Graph's vertices can be displayed with their adjacent vertices
 + According to user given source vertices searching for the reachable vertices
 + Implementation of Dijkstra Algorithm
 
### For Intialization
------------
User have to go to this [link](https://github.com/FOSSCODY-1/S.M.K.G.A.S.Subasinghe.git "link") and download the files.

In there user can find two code files in "final" folder as
  + graph.c
  + graphlib.h
User have to save the both folders in one location and after compiling the graph.c you can run the program in cmd.

For compiling you can use Dev-C++, Code::Blocks or any other IDE that you can run C programs

Or you can install GCC compilers to your PC and work in cmd.

This is the interface of the program

As you can see user have to choose their options

In the initialization step user have to enter the information about vertices and edges

After the initialization of the graph user can view the graph as shown with adjacent vertices details

After the initialization of the graph user can edit the edges if needed

According to user input source in DFS method or BFS method it can show the reachable nodes from source vertex

User can delete the vertices if need

I successfully implemented the Dijsktra in the graph

But still there are few issues when finding the shortest path from several nodes

##### So still working on that

:smile:
