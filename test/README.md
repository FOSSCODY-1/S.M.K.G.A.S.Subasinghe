# Linked list

Linked list is going to be the basic data structure I am going to use in this project 

This is a revision

This includes
- creating a link list
- inserting a node in the begining of the list
- inserting a node in the end of the list
- inserting a node before a given node in the list
- inserting a node after a given node in the list
- deleating a node

this is programmed using c language :)
